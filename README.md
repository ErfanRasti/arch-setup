# arch-setup

This Repository includes the configuration I use to setup my Arch Linux.

# Installation config

The installation configuration can be described as follows:

- File system: `btrfs`
- Disk encryption: `LUKS`
- Bootloader: `systemd-boot`
- Swap: `zram`
- Desktop environment: GNOME
- Windowing system: Wayland

I also use 11th Gen Intel® Core™ i7 processor alongside with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060. So the drivers installation instruction would be based on these hardware components.
