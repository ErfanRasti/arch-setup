# arch-setup

This Repository includes the configuration I use to setup my Arch Linux.

- It includes lots of customizations to make pure `arch` being fully functional for a daily desktop or laptop user.
- This documentation is mainly developed for Arch Linux but lots of these configurations can also be widely utilized for any Linux distro.
- All of these setup commands has been tested and used by my main system; So they are reasonably safe to use.

# Installation config (before we start)

The installation configuration can be described as follows:

- File system: `btrfs`
- Disk encryption: `LUKS`
- Bootloader: `systemd-boot`
- Swap: `zram`
- Desktop environment: GNOME
- Tiling window manager: Hyprland
- Windowing system: Wayland, X11

I also use 11th Gen Intel® Core™ i7 processor alongside NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060. So the drivers installation instruction would be based on these hardware components.
