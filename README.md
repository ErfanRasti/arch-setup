# arch-setup

This repository includes the configuration I use to setup my Arch Linux.

- It includes many customizations to make pure Arch fully functional for a daily desktop or laptop user.
- This documentation is primarily for Arch Linux, but many of these configurations can also be widely used with other Linux distros.
- All of these setup commands have been tested and used on my primary system, so they are reasonably safe to use.
- You can jump into your desired topic using the navigation menu.

# Installation config (before we start)

The installation configuration can be described as follows:

- File system: `btrfs`
- Disk encryption: `LUKS`
- Bootloader: `systemd-boot`
- Swap: `zram`
- Desktop environment: GNOME
- Tiling window manager: Hyprland
- Windowing system: Wayland, X11

I also use 11th Gen Intel® Core™ i7 processor alongside NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060. So the drivers installation instruction would be based on these hardware components.
