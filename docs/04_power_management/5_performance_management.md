## Performance Management

### Load Average

Load average, as the name suggests, depicts the average load on a CPU for a set time interval. These values are the number of processes waiting for the CPU or using it in the given period.

When you run this:

```sh
uptime
```

Under the `load average` you can see 3 values:

- The first value depicts the average load on the CPU for the last minute.
- The second gives us the average load for the last 5-minute interval
- The third value gives us the 15-minute average load
